# MinorProject(RentMyRide)
This project is a decentralized car rental service that uses blockchain technology and IPFS for secure and transparent data storage. Our platform allows car owners to list their vehicles for rent and renters to book cars directly from owners without the need for intermediaries.

Our system ensures privacy and security for all users by storing sensitive information such as user details, rental history, and vehicle details on IPFS, while using blockchain technology to securely process payments and track transactions.

Our platform features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for owners to list their cars and renters to browse and book vehicles. Additionally, we provide real-time updates on vehicle availability and booking status.

Our team is committed to providing a reliable and secure car rental service that benefits both owners and renters. We welcome contributions from developers and users alike to help improve our platform and expand its capabilities.
